GraphQL APIs are awesome and you should feel lucky if your current project has the data available through a GraphQL endpoint.

Youâ€™ve probably heard about GraphQL clients and how they make our lives much better. If you are dealing with a GraphQL API, you really should be using something like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html) or [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) to take full advantage of it.

### Life is not always beautiful

Sometimes though, we could be in a situation in which using a GraphQL client is not an option. Maybe the application is not ready yet to fully incorporate it, or maybe the server is not compatible with it yet (yes, Iâ€™ve seen this happening, I donâ€™t know why, though).

Well, GraphQL feels like a fancy new thing but at the end you are still doing the same XHR requests, as you would with REST endpoints, so you can just use a simple HTTP client like [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios):

**That works!** But sometimes you will need to compose your query or mutation with params, and maybe you will feel tempted to do something like this:

Template literals, right?! I can bring any variable into my string.

Yes, you can, but that would resolve to something like this:

```
name: Lollipop
```

When the endpoint actually would probably expect:

```
name: "Lollipop"
```

Well, then you could just put quotes around it:

    candy (
      name: "${candyNameFilter}"
    )

And that fortunately will work! But doesnâ€™t feel right. And if your variable is an object or an array, you will have to stringify and sometimes manipulate it so it gets to the desired format.

## The solution

The good thing is we can still directly pass those variables without having to format them, with the help of two libraries:

- [graphql](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)

- [graphql-tag](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag)

**First, declare your query and its variables â€” and their types (if in doubt, refer to the API documentation on GraphiQL):**

<iframe src="https://gist.github.com/dlbnco/e7ad55e8b86874a7d95b177fdb790651.pibb"></iframe>

When calling it, use graphql to print it. And the variables goes in a separate variables property:

<iframe src="https://gist.github.com/dlbnco/5949ebc6b9c68d7f90bdc8bbd700c222.pibb"></iframe>

Thatâ€™s it! The query will be composed in the right, expected format by the server.

Also, by using graphql-tag you get syntax highlighting and linting capabilities depending on the editor and extensions that will are using. This is a screenshot of my environment with VSCode and some extensions:
