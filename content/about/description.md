# Hi, I'm Mateus 👋

**I'm a software developer, raver, amateur cyclist, and yogi.**

I enjoy building software that enables people to live better through joy and well-being.

In 2017, I indulged in a 2-year journey living as a nomad while volunteering and working remotely. It enabled me to explore living, working, cycling and enjoying music in different cultures.

Now I'm settling down again in my home country to balance myself and rebuild connections that are closer to my roots.
